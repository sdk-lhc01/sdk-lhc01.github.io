            <p>I got into this photography thing a few years back, but never really took it seriously until fairly recently, so don't judge me too hard ;) Besides that, I also try to practice the arts of procrastanism and video gaming! If you'd like to take a look at my work, all my links are below this paragraph. Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
